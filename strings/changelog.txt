- The city is near-completion and able to be played properly for a full round.
- Multiple dungeons littered around the game area to explore and spelunk.
- Replacing racial stats with statpacks completely. Now you can be a super fast orc, or a slow but strong elf.
- Full adjustment of racial locks and racial lore to fit the server setting.
- Complete overhaul of the Inhumen. Similar to what you know, but no longer the same.
- Complete rewriting of the Pantheon. Same gist, but written without AI.
- And many more..
