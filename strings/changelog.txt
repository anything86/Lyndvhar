Completely new maps. All maps are functionally complete and fully playable.
Multiple layers of content outside of the city to explore.
Difficult locations with rewarding surprises for those who want to explore.
A complete removal of racials in favor of fully committing to statpacks.
Completely rewritten lore for the entire setting and races. (Don't worry, the pantheon is still there.. but some gods have rewritten lore.)
Very free-form rules allowing you to generally do what you see fit (minus what is outlined in the rules of course.)
The Inhumen Pantheon has been made completely evil, as it should be. No beating around the bush.
A decent-sized and expansive city to explore- from sewers, to caverns- from rooftops, to hallways. The map is being constantly updated and tweaked as well.
Combat is much more stamina intensive, and punishing as a result- be careful! You may find some fights that would seem paltry on other servers slightly more difficult than expected.
And much more soon..
