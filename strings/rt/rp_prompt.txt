<b>Lyndhardtia burns. An age of prosperity destroyed. What will the future hold for the world?</b>
<br>
<br>
In aeons past, the realm of BEOWRICKE was casted into existence by the fiery hammer of MALUM at the behest of ASTRATA, smithing a new realm to dot the plains of existence, intertwined. With this new realm of creation, the PANTHEON forged a world. ASTRATA took the mantle of the sun, NOC would share the skies as the moon. ABYSSOR would reign the seas, DENDOR would reign over the natural order. RAVOX would be the guarding shield of the realm, while EORA would be the patron goddess of morality and love. MALUM would become the patron of all progress, representing the power he used to create such a realm. NECRA would control the domain of the dead and their passage. XYLIX, ever the trickster of the siblings, would become the patron of all sleight of hand and trickery. But not all would be at peace forever.
<br>
<br>
A new threat had begun bubbling from the thoughts and minds of those living in the realm. The ARCHDAEMONS, those personifying the very worst aspects of mortalkind, began to emerge. With every single sinful act committed, the sin that was done would strengthen the patron of such. These archdaemons were ZIZO, MATTHIOS, GRAGGAR, and BAOTHA. With their growth in power, they waged war against the very PANTHEON. The resulting clash of Gods and Daemon nearly tore the realm of Beowricke asunder, bringing it into an age of war- of destruction. These times are known in legend as the BLOODWAKE. During this time the AASIMAR were constructed to fight the legions of lesser daemons that the Four casted from their own power. Cultists would begin to emerge, sacrificing their very souls or bodies to give to the daemons. Through these unholy acts, the TIEFLING would emerge as enslaved thralls of ZIZO. To host his own legion, the Archdaemon GRAGGAR would corrupt elvish cultists, transforming them into ORCS and GOBLINS as we know them today. During this war in a climactic battle, the ARCHDAEMONS would be defeated and casted back into the pits of the hells whence they came, where their authority and power was effectively reduced to nothing. They would be trapped for eternity in their hole, rotting and forgotten.
<br>
<br>
With the world in ruin after the Bloodwake, the PANTHEON would retreat back to their realms, leaving Beowricke effectively unattended and at the mercy of its inheritors- the mortals. Many would set up their own fiefs, and begin the slow reconstruction and recovery of the land. Many stories and legends emerge from this era, though not much is very known about it or the sagas sung of it. What is known is that this is the era when AEVISLAN was founded, and the foundation for what would become one of the strongest empires ever seen were laid.
<br>
<br>
In ages past, Aevislan was a formidable city state, ruled by the dynasty of Lyndhardtia. Formerly required to pay tribute through slaves and income to the orcish tribes of the west, it was effectively a vassal state. However, with the ascension of NAEXIDOR LYNDHARDTIA, this would forever be changed. His strength and cunning prowess on the battlefield led to successful destruction of the orc tribes, casting them into almost complete obscurity, relegated to minor tribes in the far western plains and mountains. But the conquest did not stop there, as Naexidor set his sights upon the north, the east, and parts of the west, slowly but surely conquering city after city, and nation after nation. This almost divine conquest led many in the Pantheonic Church to believe him blessed by the Ten themselves. Through his conquests the Kingdom of Lyndhardtia was formed, named after the founding dynasty, and consecrated by Naexidor. His descendants would hold onto this Kingdom for generations, bringing about almost complete dominion over Llewyn. But all empires fall eventually.
<br>
<br>
Nearly two-hundred years have passed since Naexidorâ€™s original conquest, and his dynasty has sat on the Ruby Throne of Aevislan since. However, the Queen, CAMILLA LYNDHARDTIA never had children. With her death at the age of 74 and no direct heir of the Lyndhardtia line, claimants began to emerge. 
<br>
<br>
BALERON, bastard son of the previous king before, MICHAEL, declared themself the true ruler of Lyndhardtia, and began to amass their forces.
<br>
<br>
To counter this claim, VLADISLAV, a claimant backed by many in the Pantheonic Church, also laid claim- despite having no true blood relation. He claims that Astrata herself came to him in his dreams, declaring him the true successor of Naexidor themself.
<br>
<br>
The Duke of Dunargun, GUNTHARD, also joined the pool of claimants. His claims are more popular with the common folk, as not only does he control the capitol province (and therefore the capitol itself), he had been a benevolent overseer of the heartlands. But he would not be the last one.
<br>
<br>
LAURENCE, previously one of the Grand Archmages of the Arcane Eyrie, set his eyes upon carving his own section of the realm for himself. Despite having only minor support from smallfolk and sorcerers, the strength of his magic sees almost no equal. Through this he carved out his own supporting parts of the realm.
<br>
<br>
And with this, the Kingdom of Lyndhardtia would enter an age of civil war and destruction that the world had not seen since the BLOODWAKE.
<br>
<br>
Lyndhardtia is dying; scent of shit and pus and maggot-filth in the air. With a resurgence of chaos, cultists of the daemonic deities have begun to re-amass themselves. Orders from darkness begin to resurface, once thought extinct. Whispered murmurs speak of the ARCHDAEMONS, a return to daes of destruction not seen since the Bloodwake.
<br>
<br>
Communication between cities and villages has all but become silent. LYNDVHAR has not heard word from the capital in years, and its future uncertain. Autocratic rule of decree by the Viscount has become a de-facto way of life. The Church purges anyone who seems even remotely unfaithful in order to keep the city safe. And yet still- word of darkness coming from the abyss spreads. The dead rise, goblins and orcs make camp, and boats have been seen off the coast. Banditry has made travel almost impossible, and worse has begun to brew potentially in the deepwoods - the howls of volves, and reports of blood-drained carcasses..

<b>Children of the Pantheon, the Kingdom of Lyndhardtia is tearing itself apart, destruction runs rampant, and evil resurfaces-</b> will you lose your faith in the Ten that have guided and nurtured you?
<br>
<b>Ambitious cultists, worshippers of the daemonic, and even darker-</b> will you rise up and remake this land in your image, bringing subjugation and compliance in the name of your Daemonic masters?
<br>
<b>Those of the Psydonic Orthodoxy-</b> will you yet persist as stoically and wilfully as he does, for all of humenkind?
<br>
<b>Lowly fool- will you survive the oncoming storm?</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Beowricke awaits your mask, actor.</b>
